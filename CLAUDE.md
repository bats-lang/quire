## To do: book memory in a rolling window of page arenas

Partly done: the window exists (`src/pages.bats`), and the buffers a
chapter or image is parsed from come from the current page's arena. The
rest is the intended design.

Everything that belongs to a book's content (chapter text, pictures and
other images, per-page layout data) is allocated from arenas (array's
`arena_create` / `arena_alloc`), not with `alloc`. `alloc` is bounded at
1 MiB on purpose, to limit fragmentation (see array's CLAUDE.md), and a
page's content does not belong in scattered long-lived allocations.

* One arena per page, sized to hold a page with generous limits for
  images and the like.
* Five arenas live at a time: the current page, the 2 pages before it and
  the 2 after it.
* Turning forward one page releases the arena of the page that is now 3
  back and prepares the arena of the page that is now 2 ahead (turning
  back does the mirror image): a rolling window.
* Arenas are created and destroyed whole and never reused piecemeal, so
  they cannot fragment.

The point of doing this in ATS2 rather than Rust is that the arena
discipline is checked at compile time:

* a piece that does not fit its page's arena does not type-check;
* a page's pieces cannot be freed on their own, or given back to
  another page's arena;
* a page's arena cannot be released while any of its pieces is still in
  use (the arena's outstanding count must be 0), so nothing on screen
  can point into a released page.

The window itself should be in the types too: the reader state holds
exactly the five arenas, indexed by page number, so a page outside the
window has no arena to allocate from.

### The window today

`src/pages.bats` holds it. `page_arena(q, t)` is the arena of page q of
a chapter of t pages, with no piece out; it exists only for
`0 <= q < t`. `window(p, t)` holds exactly the arenas of pages p - 2 to
p + 2. `window_forward` turns it into `window(p + 1, t)` by releasing
page p - 2's arena and making page p + 3's (`window_back` is the mirror
image), so keeping any other arena does not type-check. Each arena is
4 MiB (`PAGE_BYTES`).

The reader's window lives in a `ref` taken out and put back with
`ref_exch_elt`, since it is linear. `_show_page` moves it to the page
shown: one page on rotates it, and any other move (a jump, a new
chapter, a new page count after a resize) releases it and makes it
anew. Going back to the library releases it (`window_close`).

A buffer a book's content is parsed from (`piece_new` in
`src/book.bats`: an entry's data, a decompressed OPF, chapter or image)
is a piece of the current page's arena when it fits there
(`page_lend`). The arena leaves the window while the piece is out (its
slot is `Lent`), so the arena in the window never has a piece out, and
`page_give_back` returns it to its slot, or releases it when the window
has moved on. When there is no window yet (the first chapter's load),
or the page has no room, the piece is the one piece of an arena of its
own, as before. `piece_owner` says which, so `piece_free` gives it back
to the right one.

### Where book content is allocated today

In arena pieces (`piece` in `src/book.bats`: a piece of the current
page's arena, or the one piece of an arena sized to it, so it has no
1 MiB bound):

* an entry's compressed data (the piece `index_read` returns): the
  container.xml, the OPF and each chapter;
* decompressed content (`take_content`): the container.xml, the OPF and
  each chapter's XHTML;
* the OPF's compressed data when a chapter is loaded (`opf_cbuf`);
* each image's bytes (`_show_image` in `src/reader.bats`);
* a book's annotations while a backup is written (`annot_json`), each
  book's part of the backup, and the whole file (`backup_export`);
* a backup file while it is restored (`backup_import`).

Each piece lives only while it is parsed or written: nothing is kept
between page turns yet, since pages are CSS columns of the chapter's
DOM.

With `alloc`:

* `src/book.bats` (`book_index_make`): the archive's tail and each
  entry's local header while the book is opened, and its central
  directory (at most 1 MiB), kept while the book is open for its
  entries' names.
* `src/book_cards.bats` (import): the OPF path (`opf_path_buf`, under
  65536 bytes as a zip name is) and a title buffer (`tbuf`).
* `src/reader.bats`: the OPF's name (for its directory), the chapter
  path (`ch_buf`), and title and text copies (`exact`, `tbuf`).
* The EPUB file itself never enters wasm memory: file-input keeps it on
  the JS side, it is read by ranges, and it is saved to and restored
  from IndexedDB there (`$FI.idb_put`, `$FI.idb_get`).
* Everything else (`src/bin/quire.bats`, the small buffers in
  `reader.bats`) is element ids, event names and storage keys: UI, not
  book content; it stays on `alloc`.

### The archive is checked once

`book_begin` opens a book (an import, or a restore from IndexedDB) and
checks its archive then, once: the end record, the central directory
(zip's `cd_refs`) and every entry's local header. What survives is the
book's index (`book_index`): the kept directory and a list of entries
whose data spans are proven inside the file. Reading an entry
(`index_read`, for the container.xml, the OPF, a chapter or an image)
only looks its name up there; nothing in the file is checked again.

A book's chapters are found once too, the first time one is loaded
(`_spine_build` in `src/reader.bats`): the OPF is read and parsed, and
each spine item's href, after the OPF's directory, is looked up in the
index. The chapters (`book_chapters`, each an entry whose data span is
proven, or missing) are kept in the book (`book_spine_set`), so loading
chapter i only walks to it (`book_chapter_get`); the OPF is not read
again.

### Found while taking this inventory

* (Fixed) An EPUB larger than 1 MiB could not be imported, because the
  whole file was read into one `alloc`. Entries are now read at their
  offsets, and the file has no size bound. An entry's data and its
  decompressed content are read into arena pieces, so a chapter over
  1 MiB is shown; only the central directory is still read into one
  buffer of at most 1 MiB.
* (Fixed) Book images were not shown. A chapter's `<img>` elements are
  now filled once the chapter is rendered: each src is resolved against
  the chapter's directory ("." and ".." segments, a "#fragment"
  dropped), its entry read into an arena piece (decompressed into
  another when deflated) and handed to the element as a blob URL. An SVG
  `<image>` (a cover page's usual form) is shown the same way, as an
  `<img>` whose source is its `xlink:href` (or `href`).
