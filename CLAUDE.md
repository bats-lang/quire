## To do: book memory in a rolling window of page arenas

Partly done: the window exists (`src/pages.bats`), but nothing is
allocated from it yet. The rest is the intended design, and it will take
a good deal of refactoring.

Everything that belongs to a book's content (chapter text, pictures and
other images, per-page layout data) is allocated from arenas (array's
`arena_create` / `arena_alloc`), not with `alloc`. `alloc` is bounded at
1 MiB on purpose, to limit fragmentation (see array's CLAUDE.md), and a
page's content does not belong in scattered long-lived allocations.

* One arena per page, sized to hold a page with generous limits for
  images and the like.
* Five arenas live at a time: the current page, the 2 pages before it and
  the 2 after it.
* Turning forward one page releases the arena of the page that is now 3
  back and prepares the arena of the page that is now 2 ahead (turning
  back does the mirror image): a rolling window.
* Arenas are created and destroyed whole and never reused piecemeal, so
  they cannot fragment.

The point of doing this in ATS2 rather than Rust is that the arena
discipline is checked at compile time:

* a piece that does not fit its page's arena does not type-check;
* a page's pieces cannot be freed on their own, or given back to
  another page's arena;
* a page's arena cannot be released while any of its pieces is still in
  use (the arena's outstanding count must be 0), so nothing on screen
  can point into a released page.

The window itself should be in the types too: the reader state holds
exactly the five arenas, indexed by page number, so a page outside the
window has no arena to allocate from.

### The window today

`src/pages.bats` holds it. `page_arena(q, t)` is the arena of page q of
a chapter of t pages, with no piece out; it exists only for
`0 <= q < t`. `window(p, t)` holds exactly the arenas of pages p - 2 to
p + 2. `window_forward` turns it into `window(p + 1, t)` by releasing
page p - 2's arena and making page p + 3's (`window_back` is the mirror
image), so keeping any other arena does not type-check. Each arena is
4 MiB (`PAGE_BYTES`).

The reader's window lives in a `ref` taken out and put back with
`ref_exch_elt`, since it is linear. `_show_page` moves it to the page
shown: one page on rotates it, and any other move (a jump, a new
chapter, a new page count after a resize) releases it and makes it
anew. Going back to the library releases it (`window_close`).

### Where book content is allocated today

In arena pieces (`piece` in `src/book.bats`: the one piece of an arena
sized to it, created and destroyed whole, so it has no 1 MiB bound):

* an entry's compressed data (the piece `zip_read` returns): the
  container.xml, the OPF and each chapter;
* decompressed content (`take_content`): the container.xml, the OPF and
  each chapter's XHTML;
* the OPF's compressed data when a chapter is loaded (`opf_cbuf`);
* each image's bytes (`_show_image` in `src/reader.bats`).

Each piece lives only while it is parsed: nothing is kept between page
turns yet, since pages are CSS columns of the chapter's DOM.

With `alloc`:

* `src/book.bats` (`zip_read`): the archive's tail, its central
  directory (at most 1 MiB), and the entry's local header.
* `src/book_cards.bats` (import): the OPF path (`opf_path_buf`, under
  65536 bytes as a zip name is) and a title buffer (`tbuf`).
* `src/reader.bats`: the OPF's name (for its directory), the chapter
  path (`ch_buf`), and title and text copies (`exact`, `tbuf`).
* The EPUB file itself never enters wasm memory: file-input keeps it on
  the JS side, it is read by ranges, and it is saved to and restored
  from IndexedDB there (`$FI.idb_put`, `$FI.idb_get`).
* Everything else (`src/bin/quire.bats`, the small buffers in
  `reader.bats`) is element ids, event names and storage keys: UI, not
  book content; it stays on `alloc`.

### Found while taking this inventory

* (Fixed) An EPUB larger than 1 MiB could not be imported, because the
  whole file was read into one `alloc`. Entries are now read at their
  offsets, and the file has no size bound. An entry's data and its
  decompressed content are read into arena pieces, so a chapter over
  1 MiB is shown; only the central directory is still read into one
  buffer of at most 1 MiB.
* (Fixed) Book images were not shown. A chapter's `<img>` elements are
  now filled once the chapter is rendered: each src is resolved against
  the chapter's directory ("." and ".." segments, a "#fragment"
  dropped), its entry read into an arena piece (decompressed into
  another when deflated) and handed to the element as a blob URL. An SVG
  `<image>` (a cover page's usual form) is shown the same way, as an
  `<img>` whose source is its `xlink:href` (or `href`).
